\chapter{Extension to constant curvature spaces}
In this chapter we want to extend the Chow-Gulliver result (theorem \ref{chow gulliver}) to constant curvature spaces. We will use the same notation as in section 
\ref{reflections definitions} and \ref{method moving planes}. 
Throughout the chapter, by hyperplane we mean a totally geodesic hyperplane. 

\section{The equation in constant curvature spaces}	
As shown in \cite{huisken}, the equation we analysed in the previous chapter can be also considered in non-flat ambient spaces. In particular, we will analyse the case where the ambient space is one of those described  in section \ref{reflections definitions}: $\R^{n+1}$, $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$, or $\mathbb{S}^n_+$. We again use the symbol $\mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+$ to indicate any of these spaces. 
Let $X_0 : M^n \rightarrow \mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+$ be a manifold embedded in $\mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+$. 
Let $F:\{(\kappa_1, \dots , \kappa_n)\in \R^n\vert \kappa_1\leq \dots \leq \kappa_n\}\rightarrow \R$ be a $C^1$ function satisfying:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial F}{\partial \kappa_i} > 0 \mathrm{\; for \; all } \; i=1,\dots, n \label{parabolicitÃ _ext}
\end{equation}
and consider the evolution equation 
\begin{align}
	\begin{dcases}
		\frac{\partial X_t}{\partial t} = - F(\kappa_1(x), \dots , \kappa_n(x)) \nu\\
		X(0)= X_0
	\end{dcases} \label{evolutioneq_ext}
\end{align}
where $\nu$ is the outward normal to $X_t(M^n)$ at the point $X_t(x)$ and $\kappa_1\leq \dots \leq \kappa_n$ are the principal curvatures at $X_t(x)$. 

As we saw in the previous chapter, it is a non-linear parabolic differential equation, as the calculation in chapter \ref{parabolic} is valid for any metric on $\R^{n+1}$, and in particular, for the metrics in our models for $\mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+$ in section \ref{reflections definitions}. The existence result in \cite{huisken} also holds as well in this case. Finally, the result in section \ref{representation as graph} is not using the metric tensor, and therefore is valid in this setting as well, again because there are models on $\R^{n+1}$. 
\begin{oss}
	\em
	The hemisphere has a finite diameter in each direction. It is therefore possible that the flow stops in a finite time when it touches the equator. One could extend it a little bit by rotating the hypersurface in $S^{n+1}$ so that it only touches the equator at the last possible moment. It is however possible that the hypersurface touches its reflection {\em on the wrong side} if we let it expand past the equator, (a sphere is, after all, round). It is easier to avoid this possibility by considering only flows defined in the hemisphere. 
\end{oss}
\section{Extension of theorem \ref{chow gulliver}}	


Assume the hypothesis in section \ref{reflections definitions}: $X:M^n\rightarrow \mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+$ is a hypersurface in a constant curvature ambient space, and we choose a point and a direction $v$ to foliate the ambient space. Consider a hyperplane in the foliation, $\pi=\pi_{v, C}$. As in section \ref{reflections definitions} we can define the reflection about $\pi$. As in the previous chapter, let $X^\pi$ be the reflection of X about $\pi$.

Then, $\mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+$ is divided by $\pi$ into two half-spaces:
\begin{align*}
	H^+(\pi)= \bigcup_{s>C} \pi_{v, s} \;\;\mathrm{and}\;\;	H^-(\pi)= \bigcup_{s<C} \pi_{v, s}.
\end{align*} 

\begin{defin}
	We say {\em we can reflect $X: M^n\rightarrow \mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+$ strictly with respect to $\pi$} if both:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $X^\pi\cap H^-(\pi)\subset \mathrm{int}(X)\cap H^-(\pi)$ 
		\item The tangent spaces $T_xX$ and $T_xX^\pi$ do not coincide for each $x\in X(M^n) \cap \pi$ (when seen as subspaces of  $T_x\mathbb{M}^{n+1}$), unless  $T_xX^\pi=T_x\pi$.
	\end{itemize} 
\end{defin}
This fundamentally means that the reflection of one of the halves of $X$ on the other side of $\pi$ is contained in the region inside $M^n$ and the tangent spaces of $X$ and of the half-reflection do not form a ninety degree angle with $\pi$, at all points on $\pi\cap X$. As the two tangent spaces are one the reflection of the other, this means that they do not coincide.   
\begin{defin}
	We say {\em we can reflect $X: M^n\rightarrow \R^{n+1}$ strictly up to $(\pi,v)$} if we can reflect $M^n$ strictly with respect to $\pi_{v, s}$ for all hyperplanes $\pi_{v, s}$ such that $s<C$.  
\end{defin}

The result then becomes:


\begin{theorem}[Extended Chow-Gulliver]\label{chow gulliver extended}
	Let $X:M^n\times [0,T) \rightarrow \mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+$ be a $C^2$ solution to equation (\ref{evolutioneq_ext}). Then, if we can reflect $X(M^n, 0)=M_0$ strictly with respect to $\pi$, then for all $t\in [0,T)$ we can reflect $X(M^n, t)=M_t$ strictly with respect to $\pi$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	As before, by contradiction, suppose that there is a time $t$ such that the thesis is false, and that it is the smallest such $t$. Then, for all $\tau \in [0,t)$, $M_{\tau,\pi}\cap H^-(\pi)\subset \mathrm{int}(M_{\tau})\cap H^-(\pi)$; the unit vector orthogonal to $\pi$, $V$, is such that $V\notin T_xM_\tau$ for all $x\in M_\tau\cap \pi$ and $\tau \in [0,t)$; and either of the conditions fails at $t$, i.e. either: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(i)] $M_{t,\pi}\cap H^-(\pi)\cap M_{t}\neq \emptyset$
		\item[(ii)] The tangent spaces $T_xX$ and $T_xX^\pi$ coincide for some $x\in\pi$. 
	\end{itemize} 
	
	(i) Suppose the first case is true. Then, there exists $x_0 \in M_{t,\pi}\cap H^-(\pi)\cap M_{t}$ such that at $x_0$ the two manifolds are tangent. \\
	We can then reason as in the proof of theorem \ref{chow gulliver}.
	
	(ii) Suppose instead that  $T_xM_t= T_xM_t^\pi$ and in a neighbourhood of $(x, t)$ both $M_t$ and $M_t^\pi$ are graphs of two smooth functions over $T_xM_t$ by \ref{localgraph}, i.e. again
	\begin{align*}
		f \; : \; (x, t) &\mapsto x+\tilde{f}(x, t)\nu \\
		f_\pi \; : \; (x, t) &\mapsto x+\tilde{f}_\pi(x, t)\nu 
	\end{align*} 
	We can do this because the theorem allowing us to do so is a theorem on smooth manifolds, and requires nothing on the metric, therefore the existence of models in $\R^{n+1}$ of the ambient spaces allows us to do the same procedure. 
	Reasoning again as in the proof of theorem \ref{chow gulliver}, in $\overline{H^-(\pi)}$, $f_\pi\geq f$, because $M^n_\pi\cap H^-(\pi)\subset \mathrm{int}(M^n)\cap H^-(\pi)$. Finally, $f(x, t)=f_\pi (x, t)$, hence $f_\pi-f (x, t)=0$, and thus  $(x, t)$ is a minimum point on the boundary for $f_\pi-f$. Also, for the outward pointing normal to the boundary $V$
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{\partial f}{\partial V}(x,t)=\frac{\partial f_\pi}{\partial V}(x,t)
	\end{align*}
	because the graphs are both tangent to $T_xM_t$. We note also that the models in section \ref{reflections definitions} are conformal, so a vector is orthogonal to the boundary if and only if it is orthogonal to the corresponding region when seen as a region in $\R^{n+1}$. Thus, 
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{\partial (f- f_\pi)}{\partial V}(x,t)=0
	\end{align*}
	But we must have 
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{\partial (f- f_\pi)}{\partial V}(x,t)>0
	\end{align*}
	at a minimum on the boundary by Proposition \ref{secondapplication}, a contradiction.  
\end{proof}
\section{Extending Corollaries}

We now shift the focus to extending the corollaries of theorem \ref{chow gulliver} in section \ref{Some corollaries of the result}. 

The author is not aware of a standard definition of a support and a radial function in a curved setting, so we do not attempt to extend the results in section \ref{Applying the result to find gradient estimates}. 

Clearly, corollary \ref{upto} has a direct equivalent in this setting:
\begin{cor}
	Let $X:M^n\times [0,T) \rightarrow \mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+$ be a $C^2$ solution to equation (\ref{evolutioneq}). Then, if we can reflect $X_0$ strictly up to $(\pi_{v,C},v)$, for all $t\in [0,T)$ we can reflect $X_t$ strictly up to $(\pi_{v,C},v)$.  
\end{cor}

The second result that we can extend is Corollary \ref{graph}, although the meaning of \textit{graph} in curved spaces is ambiguous. We adapt the corollary as follows: 


\begin{cor}
	Let $X:M^n\times [0,T) \rightarrow \mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+$ be a $C^2$ embedded solution to equation (\ref{evolutioneq_ext}). Then, if we can reflect $X_0$ strictly up to $(\pi_{v,C},v)$, then for all $t\in [0,T)$, $X_t \cap H^+(\pi_{v,C})$ is such that the projection of the coordinates of its points onto $\pi_{v,C}$, $(p, \tau)\mapsto p$, is injective. 
\end{cor}
This condition guarantees that we can build a map from $s:\overline{\mathrm{int}(X_t \cap \pi_{v,C})}\rightarrow \R$ such that $(p, s(p))\in X_t$, making $p\mapsto (p, s(p))$ act as a sort of curved graph. 
\begin{proof}
	By  theorem \ref{chow gulliver extended} we can reflect up to $(\pi_{v,C},v)$ at all times in $[0,T)$. Let $\gamma_p(s)=(p, s+C)$ be the path followed by $p\in \pi_{v,C}$ as the planes sweep through the ambient space. If two points exist with the same $p$ coordinate, say $(p, C_1)$ and $(p, C_2)$, the reflection about the hyperplane $\pi_{v,\frac{ C_1 +  C_2}{2}}$ would map one onto the other, but as both $C_1$ and $C_2$ are greater than $C$, then we should also be able to reflect strictly about it by theorem \ref{chow gulliver extended}, as we would have $\frac{ C_1 +  C_2}{2}>C$. 
\end{proof}

Let $\tilde{B}_r(y) = \{ p \in \mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+  : \mathrm{dist}(p, y) < r \}$. Reasoning exactly like in corollary \ref{reflect a small bit}, we also can extend it to this setting:  
\begin{cor}
	Let $X:M^n\times [0,T) \rightarrow \mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+$ be a $C^2$ embedded solution to equation (\ref{evolutioneq_ext}). There exists $\varepsilon>0$ depending only on $X_0$ such that for all $t\in[0, T)$ we can reflect $X_t$ up to $(\Pi_0^v +\epsilon v, v)$ for every $v \in S^n$. In particular, if $X_0 \subset \tilde{B}_R(C)$, then we can always reflect $X_t$ up to $(\Pi, v)$ whenever $H^+(\Pi)\cap \tilde{B}_{R-\varepsilon}(C)=\emptyset$.\label{reflect a small bit ext}
\end{cor}
Other corollaries of the section, like Corollary \ref{x projection estimate} and Corollary \ref{sandwich estimate} are harder to extend, as they rely on the points at each plane moving along geodesics on the plane, which is not true in the curved case. (see remarks \ref{inequality1} and \ref{inequality2})
\begin{comment}
{\Large \textbf{[Corollary \ref{x projection estimate} - If/when it can be done  - DA SCRIVERE]}}

{\Large \textbf{[Corollary \ref{sandwich estimate} - If/when it can be done  - DA SCRIVERE]}} I fear that this one cannot be done because the line mapping the minimum into the maximum in the reflection is not a geodesic anymore in the hyperbolic case
\end{comment}


\section{Extending theorem \ref{pointexpanding}}

It is also possible to extend the result in section \ref{SinestRisaResult} to $\mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+$. We consider {\em expansive} solutions to \ref{evolutioneq_ext} which are defined on a larger interval $(T_0, T_1)$, with  $-\infty \leq T_0 \leq 0 < T_1 \leq \infty$. Like before: 
\begin{defin}
	We say that a solution to equation (\ref{evolutioneq_ext}) is {\em expansive} if $F<0$. 
\end{defin}
Like in the euclidean case, expansive solutions are those where $\frac{\partial X_t}{\partial t}$ is an outward pointing vector. 
\begin{defin}
	Let $ X : M^n \times (T_0, T_1) \to \mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+ $ be an embedded expansive solution to equation (\ref{evolutioneq_ext}). We say that {\em $X$ comes out of a point} if there exists a point $y_\infty$ such that for every $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a time $\tau \in  (T_0, T_1)$ such that $X_\tau \subset \tilde{B}_\varepsilon(y_\infty)$, where $\tilde{B}_r(y) = \{ p \in \mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+  : \mathrm{dist}(p, y) < r \}$.
\end{defin}


Like in the euclidean case, homothetically expanding distance spheres satisfy the equation: distance spheres have constant principal curvatures in $\mathrm{M}^{n+1}_+$ as well; thus, any spherical solution is completely determined by its radius at time $t$, because the equation is invariant at each point. Again, the ordinary differential equation $r'(t) = \varphi(r(t))$ completely determines the flow, where $\varphi(r) = -F(\frac{1}{r}, \dots, \frac{1}{r})$. Like before, we can find an ancient solution if and only if
\begin{align*}
	\int_{0}^{c}\frac{1}{\varphi(r)} dr =+\infty.
\end{align*}
It is no surprise that in constant curvature spaces we can prove a statement equivalent to theorem \ref{pointexpanding}:

\begin{theorem}
	Let $ X : M^n \times (T_0, T_1) \to \mathbb{M}^{n+1}_+ $ be a smooth, closed, embedded expansive solution to equation (\ref{evolutioneq_ext}) coming out of a point. Then it is a family of expanding distance spheres. \label{expandingflowext}
\end{theorem}
\begin{oss}\em
	At a glance, it could be confusing why the shape changes, after all it is not immediately apparent what changes in equation  	\ref{evolutioneq_ext} from the previous chapter, as we do not find the metric in it, and one might wonder if it could be seen as a version of equation  \ref{evolutioneq} with a different $F$. This is not the case, as computing the principal curvatures interacts with the metric at a fundamental level, making it so that the two equations are not comparable.
\end{oss}

The proof is effectively the same as before: 
\begin{proof}
	Fix any hyperplane $\pi$ not passing through $y_\infty$. There is $R>0$ such that $ \tilde{B}_{2R}(y_\infty)$ does not intersect it. By definition, there is also a time  $\tau \in  (T_0, T_1)$ such that $X_\tau \subset \tilde{B}_R(y_\infty)$. 
	By Corollary \ref{reflect a small bit ext}, then, we can reflect strictly $X_t$ up to $\pi$ for any $t>\tau$. 
	
	Now consider a sequence  $\epsilon_n\rightarrow 0$. Up to a subsequence, we can then find a corresponding converging non-increasing sequence $\tau_n\rightarrow \overline{t}\in [T_0, T_1)$ (here note that $\overline{t}$ can be $-\infty$) such that $X_{\tau_n}\subseteq B_{\epsilon_n}(y_\infty)$, therefore in $(\tau_n, T_1)$ I can reflect up to any hyperplane outside  $\tilde{B}_{\epsilon_n}(y_\infty)$ in any direction, reasoning like we just did. At time $\overline{t}$, $X_{\overline{t}} \subseteq \cap_r  \tilde{B}_{r}(y_\infty) = \{y_\infty\}$, thus we would have a singularity at $\overline{t}$ if  $\overline{t}\in(T_0, T_1)$ and therefore $\overline{t}=T_0$. 
	
	On the other hand, by construction, we can reflect $X_{t}$ strictly about any hyperplane not intersecting $\cap_r B_{r}(y_\infty) = \{y_\infty\}$ at any time $t>\overline{t}=T_0$, hence we can reflect $X_{t}$ strictly up to any hyperplane passing through $y_\infty$, in both directions, at any  time $t\in (T_0, T_1)$. We observe that in the limit, the reflection property becomes non-strict, in the sense that we have to replace the interior of $X$ in definition \ref{strict-reflection-definition} with its closure, therefore $X_{t}$ may touch its reflection at the limit plane, i.e. the one passing through $y_\infty$. Similarly, it cannot be that the other condition is the one causing the strict reflection definition to fail, as the other condition stays instead strict. 
	
	This implies that, taking any hyperplane passing through $y_\infty$ and considering opposite directions for the reflection, $X_{t}$ is symmetric about said hyperplane for any time $t\in (T_0, T_1)$. By Proposition \ref{proposition symmetry conclusion}, then, we conclude that $X_{t}$ must be a ball.	
\end{proof}

\section{Shrinking flows on the sphere}

As noted in \cite{summary}, something can be said about the opposite problem for a shrinking flow on the sphere $S^{n+1}$. In fact, shrinking flows of convex manifolds on a sphere are also quite rigid, and are limited under certain condition to being shrinking spheres. This was shown in \cite{BryanIvakiScheuer}. 

\begin{defin}
	We say that a solution to equation (\ref{evolutioneq_ext}) is {\em shrinking} if $F\geq 0$, and $F(0)=0$. 
\end{defin}
The condition $F(0)=0$ ensures that equators on the sphere are static solutions to equation (\ref{evolutioneq_ext}). On the whole sphere one must choose a conventional direction for the unit normal. 


\begin{theorem}
	Let $ X : M^n \times (T_0, T_1) \to S^{n+1}_+ $ be a smooth, convex, embedded shrinking solution to equation (\ref{evolutioneq_ext}), and $ (T_0, T_1)$ be the maximum interval where the solution is defined. Suppose also that:
	\begin{align*}
		\limsup_{t\rightarrow T_0} \max_{X_t} \sum_i \kappa_i(x)<\infty
	\end{align*}
	Then $X_t$ is a distance sphere for all $t\in  (T_0, T_1)$.
\end{theorem}

The proof of this result is long and involved, and the main result in \cite{BryanIvakiScheuer}. It also uses a reflection argument, but not precisely the Alexandrov Moving Planes method. 
\begin{oss}
	\em
	This result acts as a sort of converse for theorem \ref{expandingflowext} on the hemisphere, showing that all ancient convex shrinking solutions on the sphere are the trivial shrinking spheres. 
\end{oss}
